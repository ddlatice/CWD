## So, I started a Blog and here's why.

Let me start from the beginning. I pretty much didn't know what I wanted to do with my life since high school. I graduated in 2012 and decided to major in Biology for college, just on the hunch that I enjoyed science. Now, don't get me wrong... I do enjoy science. But I found out that being a Bio major for 5 years (yeah I was that super senior...) didn't bring me any steps closer to anything that felt like a 'passion'. Upon graduating with a BS in Biology , I accepted the fact that I really didn't want to go futher in the field. It didnt allow me any personal creativity.. and ya'll, I consider myself an artist (PLEASE don't ask why I didnt major in any Arts).

At the time, I was actually teaching myself photography (something that I still very much enjoy and I am good at. Check out [my work](https://dominiqueduncan6.wixsite.com/mysite)). I wanted to pursue a career that could mix my creative talents with my science background. I pondered on my life experience and was reminded of a Web Design class I took in high school. I thought, ' If I loved it then... why wouldnt I love it now? '... That led me to make a decision to go back to school and study Computer Science. Let me just say, NO. I didn't know what I was getting into. I was in no way prepared for this wild ride, getting a CS degree in 2 years. But this coming August I will be graduting from Auburn University. üêØ WDE.

My passion is Front-End , and I want to get into UX/UI Design. My curriculum didnt really focus on the stuff that I was into, so I have been basically teaching myself. I want to be a CSS, Javascript , PHP, Angular, etc.. MASTER. It's really my dream to be the greatest at this thing. I love coding. I love creating. <i>C'est la vie</i>. I started this blog because I believe writing about what I've learned will simply make me a better programmer. It's all about growth, baby.

On this blog I'll be babbling about some HTML, CSS and Javascript topics that interest me/intrigue me/drive me crazy.... and maybe I can help someone else gain a better understanding of these topics in the process.

I hope ya'll enjoy the stuff I write.

Peace + Hair Grease,
<br>
Dom.
