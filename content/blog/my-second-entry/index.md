Ok so..... I was introduced into the world of Javascript not too long ago in a Web Development class for school (WAR EAGLE). When I started learning about JavaScript, BOOM. I was immediately introduced to JQuery. JQuery is basically this huge JavaScript library programmers use to simplify the language. [Learn More Here.](https://jquery.com) It's short, sweet, cute. And It made me feel like... wow , learning JavaScript is easier than I thought.

But then something bothered me. Typing up a little JQuery here and there wasn't giving me that feeling of wholesome understanding. Like I was drinking Kool-Aid without really knowing the flavor.

I decided WHOA THERE. I need to backtrack. I had heard / read about the term 'Vanilla JS'. It always appealed to me, because it sounds like ice cream. But NOW it appealed to me because it sounded like the solution to my worries. 'Vanilla JS' is a term that refers to writing plain JavaScript, without any additional frameworks or libraries.

Having just started my comp sci degree in 2018.. and kind of being fresh on the programming scene, I thought learning frameworks and libraries would be easy.. But over time I realied the only thing that would make learning these tools 'easy' would be to have rock solid understanding of the programming language in my tool belt.

When you understand a language like JavaScript at its core level, everything else will come. Everything else just <i> flows</i>.

An article from Snipcart says :
<em>
"If you master JavaScript fundamentals, your only challenge when learning new JS frameworks will be scoped to their specific syntax."
</em>

Straight facts.

I realized I couldn't cloud my brain with frameworks and libraries before I knew for sure what I was doing with them.

I've programmed in Java, Python , C++ and C#. But for some reason, I found JavaScript more difficult to grasp. So realizing I needed to solidify my Vanilla JS understanding was the motivation I needed to start over. Start over learning JS from scratch. This meant: Reading 'You Dont Know JS' (shoutout to Github for posting this series for free), repeatedly going over concepts that were hazy , signing up for Watch and Code, and spending time working through exercises on FreeCodeCamp (FCC).

Essentially I did take steps back ... but I needed to in order to keep moving forward. I'm still in the process of gaining better understanding, making more complex projects, and solving new problems with JS. It's pretty exciting.

My ultimate goal is to feel a sense of mastery when I'm coding in JS and using those fancy frameworks and libraries.

So yeah... plenty of programmers will advise you to learn Vanilla JS without jumping into the extras. I wholeheartedly agree.

And if you find yourself confused on something you THINK you should already know, don't be afraid to do a refresher. Don't be afraid to get back to the basics.
